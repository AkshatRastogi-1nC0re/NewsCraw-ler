As the world is evolving we often donâ€™t have time to listen to or watch news online or on television in order for us to get the information we want for a particular topic. Suppose you wanted to find the latest news about Reliance because you have invested in their stocks, it would take you a lot of time and energy to go to google and manually scrape out news headlines and their descriptions whilst you are bombarded with advertisements that drastically reduce your reading time and cause irritation. By using the news crawler you can let the AI scrape out news articles from around the world and read them out to you one at a time.

This script uses [News API](https://newsapi.org/)
You can get your own API key from their website and place it inside the script to get started.
